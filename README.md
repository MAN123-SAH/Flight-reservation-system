# Flight-reservation-system
A simple, interactive airline reservation system developed in C++ with a user-friendly terminal interface. This project demonstrates basic concepts of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, inheritance, vectors, and input/output formatting, while simulating a real-world flight booking experience.

Features
<br>
-Book a flight seat
<br>
-Cancel a booking
<br>
-View available flights
<br>
-Passenger validation (no duplicate bookings per flight)
<br>
-Live loading effect for better user experience
<br>
-Object-oriented design with modular class structure

Tech Stack
<br>
Language: C++
<br>
Libraries Used:
<br>
<iostream> – input/output
<br>
<vector> – dynamic array for passengers
<br>
<iomanip> – formatted output
<br>
<thread> & <chrono> – for simulating loading effects
<br>
<algorithm> – for booking/cancellation logic

Future Enhancements
<br>
-Save bookings to file or database
<br>
-User login and authentication
<br>
-Add multiple airlines and search filters
<br>
-Flight time and duration tracking
<br>
-Graphical User Interface (GUI)
